Clients\n     are responsible for serializing and deserializing the objects that contain\n     their internal state. Once a ControllerRevision has been successfully\n     created, it can not be updated. The API Server will fail validation of all\n     requests that attempt to mutate the Data field. ControllerRevisions may,\n     however, be deleted. Note that, due to its use by both the DaemonSet and\n     StatefulSet controllers for update and rollback, this object is beta.\n     However, it may be subject to name and representation changes in future\n     releases, and clients should not depend on its stability.

CSI\n     drivers do not need to create the CSINode object directly. As long as they\n     use the node-driver-registrar sidecar container, the kubelet will\n     automatically populate the CSINode object for the CSI driver as part of\n     kubelet plugin registration. CSINode has the same name as a node. If the\n     object is missing, it means either there are no CSI Drivers available on\n     the node, or the Kubelet version is low enough that it doesn't create this\n     object.

For a\n     given StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular\n     topology segment. This can be used when considering where to instantiate\n     new PersistentVolumes. For example this can express things like: -\n     StorageClass \"standard\" has \"1234 GiB\" available in\n     \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1\" - StorageClass \"localssd\" has \"10\n     GiB\" available in \"kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123\" The following three\n     cases all imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: -\n     no object exists with suitable topology and storage class name - such an\n     object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object exists, but the\n     capacity is zero The producer of these objects can decide which approach is\n     more suitable.

Can support many different\n     deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates,\n     and fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks.\n     Each individual deployment is represented as a replication controller. A\n     deployment is \"triggered\" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an\n     Image Stream is changed. Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control\n     over a deployment. The \"strategy\" determines how the deployment is carried\n     out and may be changed at any time. The `latestVersion` field is updated\n     when a new deployment is triggered by any means.

Images are named by taking a hash of their contents\n     (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata\n     results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster\n     administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users\n     instead access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages\n     resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that\n     implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage\n     for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.

Users typically update the\n     spec.tags field to point to external images which are imported from\n     container registries using credentials in your namespace with the pull\n     secret type, or to existing image stream tags and images which are\n     immediately accessible for tagging or pulling. The history of images\n     applied to a tag is visible in the status.tags field and any user who can\n     view an image stream is allowed to tag that image into their own image\n     streams. Access to pull images from the integrated registry is granted by\n     having the \"get imagestreams/layers\" permission on a given image stream.\n     Users may remove a tag by deleting the imagestreamtag resource, which\n     causes both spec and status for that tag to be removed. Image stream\n     history is retained until an administrator runs the prune operation, which\n     removes references that are no longer in use. To preserve a historical\n     image, ensure there is a tag in spec pointing to that image by its digest.\n     Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12\n     months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).\n\n","imagestreamtags":"KIND:     ImageStreamTag\nVERSION:  image.openshift.io/v1\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n     ImageStreamTag represents an Image that is retrieved by tag name from an\n     ImageStream.

The\n     image associated with this resource is the most recently successfully\n     tagged, imported, or pushed image (as described in the image stream\n     status.tags.items list for this tag). If an import is in progress or has\n     failed the previous image will be shown. Deleting an image stream tag\n     clears both the status and spec fields of an image stream. If no image can\n     be retrieved for a given tag, a not found error will be returned.\n     Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12\n     months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).\n\n","imagetags":"KIND:     ImageTag\nVERSION:  image.openshift.io/v1\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n     ImageTag represents a single tag within an image stream and includes the\n     spec, the status history, and the currently referenced image (if any) of\n     the provided tag. This type replaces the ImageStreamTag by providing a full\n     view of the tag. ImageTags are returned for every spec or status tag\n     present on the image stream. If no tag exists in either form a not found\n     error will be returned by the API. A create operation will succeed if no\n     spec tag has already been defined and the spec field is set. Delete will\n     remove both spec and status elements from the image stream.

In a normal cluster\n     project administrators are not able to alter their quotas - that is\n     restricted to cluster administrators. Listing or watching projects will\n     return only projects the user has the reader role on. An OpenShift project\n     is an alternative representation of a Kubernetes namespace.

The route may further\n     specify TLS options and a certificate, or specify a public CNAME that the\n     router should also accept for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. An administrator\n     typically configures their router to be visible outside the cluster\n     firewall, and may also add additional security, caching, or traffic\n     controls on the service content. Routers usually talk directly to the\n     service endpoints. Once a route is created, the `host` field may not be\n     changed. Generally, routers use the oldest route with a given host when\n     resolving conflicts. Routers are subject to additional customization and\n     may support additional controls via the annotations field. Because\n     administrators may configure multiple routers, the route status field is\n     used to return information to clients about the names and states of the\n     route under each router. If a client chooses a duplicate name, for\n     instance, the route status conditions are used to indicate the route cannot\n     be chosen. To enable HTTP/2 ALPN on a route it requires a custom\n     (non-wildcard) certificate. This prevents connection coalescing by clients,\n     notably web browsers. We do not support HTTP/2 ALPN on routes that use the\n     default certificate because of the risk of connection re-use/coalescing.\n     Routes that do not have their own custom certificate will not be HTTP/2\n     ALPN-enabled on either the frontend or the backend.
